# WIP

A fork of [**jraynolds**](https://github.com/jraynolds)'s [**Glimmer and Gloom Script**](https://github.com/jraynolds/Glimmer-and-Gloom).
> # Glimmer-and-Gloom
> A python automated bot to play Flight Rising's Glimmer and Gloom minigame on the Very Hard difficulty.
> The bot will work its way, clicking down from the top left to the bottom right. When it runs out of gloom hexes that aren't on the bottom right edges, it'll calculate the appropriate glimmers to click on and work them down to cancel out the remaining edge hexes. Calculations from the excellent <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zrLIjer2FKmknXpyopCSEfVDdEP5rgxWsTOBVFkW8lQ/edit#gid=0">spreadsheet</a> done by <a href="https://flightrising.com/main.php?p=lair&tab=userpage&id=186567">Sqld</a>.
> If at any time the program has to be stopped, move your cursor to the top left corner of the screen and keep it there. That will terminate the project.

# Set-up
## Requirements
- Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - Pip (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/#get-pip-py) (Download get-pip.py and use the commands)

## Installation
- Download Python through the official website
  - During the installaton, there will be a option to add Python to PATH. **Make sure to toggle it on!** This will allow you to install the other two things without requiring to manually add Python to PATH. <img align="right" height="200" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/778281142415392799/1035953129256136779/python_option.png">
